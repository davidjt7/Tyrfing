    heroDescription:
      "The original hero of Fire Emblem himself, Marth is finally given the justice he deserves through his own legendary form. Donning a new fancy Falchion and the Fire Emblem itself, Legendary Marth serves as an incredibly strong sword infantry unit with many upsides and very few downsides."

    heroDescription:
      "Alm comes through as another wielder of the divine blade Falchion, making him the fourth unit in the game to possess this weapon. His balanced stat line makes him appear to be the least desirable of the Falchion users, but this is absolutely not the case. Thanks to his refined Falchion, Alm went from being the least desirable Falchion user to arguably the best of the bunch."

    heroDescription:
      "Seliph is the son of Sigurd, and hails from Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War. He is a red sword-wielding infantry, the typical unit archetype for lords appearing in the game. However, his low Speed and extremely high HP make him quite unlike any other unit."

    heroDescription:
      "Roy is the main lord from Fire Emblem: Binding Blade, and is the wielder of the game’s namesake weapon. Long considered not viable due to his mediocre statline and weapon, he now has a new lease on life due to the weapon refinery granting him powerful new effects on his Binding Blade."

    heroDescription:
      "Ephraim, the prince of Renais himself, comes riding into battle as the first Fire Legendary Hero available. Coming through with a mount and a new set of skills, Legendary Ephraim serves as a powerful lance Cavalry unit who benefits from recklessly charging ahead into battle, a very befitting playstyle for one such as Ephraim."
